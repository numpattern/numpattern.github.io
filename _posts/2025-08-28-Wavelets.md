When it comes to wavelet analysis, a common question is: Which wavelet is best for my signal? The answer isn’t universal—it depends entirely on the nature of your data and what features you’re trying to extract.
Wavelets are mathematical functions that decompose signals into time-frequency space. Each wavelet has its own shape, symmetry, and localization properties. Choosing the best wavelet means finding one whose characteristics align with the structure of your signal. For example, if you're analyzing a sinusoidal signal, the Morlet wavelet—which resembles a localized sine wave—is a natural fit. It offers excellent frequency resolution and produces a scalogram with clean, horizontal bands. If you're working with transient features like spikes or impulses, wavelets like the Mexican Hat or Gaussian derivatives are better suited. These wavelets are sharply localized in time and highlight sudden changes with precision.

The visual output of a wavelet transform should reveal the signal’s key features clearly on a scalogram. For periodic signals, you want consistent frequency bands. For chirps, you expect diagonal ridges that track frequency changes over time. For impulses, you look for sharp vertical bursts across scales. 

Ultimately, the appropiate wavelet is one that makes your signal’s structure most interpretable. It minimizes artifacts, enhances relevant features, and aligns with the goals of your analysis—whether that’s classification, denoising, or feature extraction. Wavelet selection isn’t just a technical choice—it’s a creative one. It’s about matching the lens to the landscape. And once you find the right fit, your signal’s hidden story becomes beautifully clear.
