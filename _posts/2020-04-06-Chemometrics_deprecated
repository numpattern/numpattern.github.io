**Specifications:**
These are the specifications of my laptop, as you can see not much is needed.

Windows Edition:        | Windows 10 Pro
Processor:              | Intel(R) Core i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30 GHz 2.40 GHz
Installed memory (RAM): | 8.00 GB (7.87 GB usable)
System type:            | 64-bit Operating System, x64 based processor

**Assumptions:**
- We have succesfully installed Anaconda3 (I recommend  version 3 instead of 2)
- We wish to work with Jupyter notebooks
- We are agree to use Conda environments

Jupyter Notebook can be called by means of your  command line interface _Anaconda prompt_ on Windows. To do that type _Anaconda_ on your windows search field, once we are in the prompt, just type _jupyter notebook_ and press Enter, it will call jupyter notebook. We can also initialize the _Anaconda Navigator_ and launch _jupyter notebook_ option while in the _Home_ tab (I prefer to execute tasks since the prompt)

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful choice to write and iterate on Python code for data analysis, you are able to write lines of code and run them one at a time. 

You can start by knowing your active environment by default which is named _base_ so try the following on your Anaconda prompt:

```python
#To know the version of your conda
conda --version
#To know the default python version installed in your conda enviroment
python --version
#To get a list of all environments installed, you could try also just _conda info_ for detailed destription of the current active environment.
conda info --envs
```

The packages chemometrics and chemotools are useful to perform basic pre-processing and modeling of signals.
